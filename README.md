# Flight Price Prediction System

## Description
This project uses machine learning to predict flight prices based on booking dates, departure dates, airlines, and routes. It helps travellers make informed booking decisions by forecasting future flight prices and providing a practical solution to the problem of fluctuating airfare costs.

## Problem Statement
Flight prices fluctuate significantly due to booking time, seasonality, airline, and demand. This unpredictability makes it challenging for travellers to find the best prices, often leading to overpayment or missed opportunities for better deals.

## Solution
Developing a flight price prediction system using machine learning to forecast future prices based on historical data and relevant features. This system will help travellers identify the best times to book flights, saving money and reducing booking uncertainty.

## Features
- Load and preprocess flight price data.
- Train machine learning models (Random Forest) for price prediction.
- Visualize prediction results with plots.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ableboy/flight-price-prediction.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd flight-price-prediction

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Use Case
This project is designed to help travellers make informed decisions about when to book flights by predicting future prices. It is also useful for educational purposes in learning and demonstrating machine learning regression algorithms.
